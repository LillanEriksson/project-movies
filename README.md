# Project Movies

This project is for practicing fetching from API's with react, using react-router-dom for handling the pages.

## The problem

I started with the functionality, fetching all the data and getting the information needed on the pages, then I styled everything. I chose to make a stylesheet for every page or component to make them easier to reuse.
